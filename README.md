This is a prototype I used to test the capability of a local LLM calling API calls out of its scope just by analysing what the user is asking, the LLM endpoint used here is an Opensource one for anyone to try it out.
However, the actual project will use a local LLM that is trained over RAG, which is part of my Internship at NSE India
